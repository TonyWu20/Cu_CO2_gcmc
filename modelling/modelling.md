# Model of Cu_cav@C reactor

![Structure](./CuCav-CH3@C_zoom.png)

- Structure: Cu nanoparticle core wrapped by porous carbon layer shell, with
  cavities in the carbon layer shell;
- particle size of the Cu nanoparticle: 35 nm
- distance between the Cu nanoparticle and porous carbon layer: 8.22 ± 1.85 nm
- the HAADF-STEM images confirmed the crystalline nature of the copper cores,
  with evident twinning, as exemplified by a representative five-fold twinned
  structure.
